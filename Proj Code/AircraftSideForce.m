classdef AircraftSideForce
        % The purpose of the AircraftSideForce Object is to calculate the
        % side force gradient on the aircraft. This gradient represents the
        % slope between the side force and the side slip angle, providing
        % data for understanding the aircraft's lateral aerodynamic characteristics.
